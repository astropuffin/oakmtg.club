#### Introduction

GIAT TYPO

Noel Gallo is the incumbent in the District 5 City Council race. He was first elected to City Council in 2013 and is serving his second four year term. Before his election to the City Council, he served on the Oakland Board of Education for 20 years.

#### Official platform

Gallo’s [official platform policies](https://www.noelgalloforoakland.com/priorities) are pretty vague, but he famously loves to talk about the weekly trash pick-up he does with volunteers every Saturday and Sunday in District 5. Trash is the main thing Gallo talks about during Council meetings, second only to unsheltered residents, who Gallo blames for the trash. During [a July 21 debate over an ordinance that would allow vacant lot owners to rent the space to RVs](https://twitter.com/DarwinBondGraha/status/1285742647080914944), Gallo said: *"I would like to share \[unsheltered residents] with those up in the hills and north Oakland so that everyone gets to share the experience that District 7 and 5 are experiences...right now Oakland is a dump in many areas, and we allowed that to happen."* Gallo openly resents unsheltered residents, and [once lied about Home Depot having to close](https://twitter.com/hyphy_republic/status/1120710552387325952?s=20) because of them so that he could justify evicting an encampment.

Officially, Gallo lists his priorities as Homelessness, Affordable Housing, Clean/Safe Streets, COVID response & resiliency, Small Business/Economic Development, Children & Education, and Pedestrian Safety & Transportation Improvements. In City Council meetings, however, he mostly talks about trash. **<-- citation or examples needed**
