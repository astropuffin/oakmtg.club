## Candidates

There are eight (8!!) candidates running for AD18 Assemblymember. This is a powerful, state-level position that typically only comes up for grabs every 12 years -- so anyone with any political ambition or interest will run when the opportunity arises!

#### [Janani Ramachandran](https://jananiforca.com/) (Oakland)
- The only Oakland candidate
- Also apparently the only candidate to [file her campaign finance information](https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Candidates/list.aspx?electNav=173)??
- Endorsed by Oakland politics legend [Gene Hazzard](http://www.cleanoakland.com/genes-blog), someone admired here at the #oakmtg (Appreciation) Club
- [Some other notable individual endorsements](https://jananiforca.com/endorsements/): Alfred Twu, Randy Shaw, Desley Brooks
- [Notable organization endorsements](https://jananiforca.com/endorsements/): ILWU NCDC, Indivisible East Bay, Wellstone Democrats, Oakland East Bay Democratic Club
- Rents in Oakland

#### [Malia Vella](https://maliavella.com/) (Alameda)
- Alameda City Council member
- [Was more endorsed than any other candidate until Mia Bonta's campaign website went live](https://maliavella.com/endorsements/)
- [Very odd endorsement list mix](https://maliavella.com/endorsements/): Jovanka Beckles _and_ Libby Schaaf and Don Perata? 
- [Notable organization endorsements](https://maliavella.com/endorsements/): Oakland Rising Action, SEIU, Coalition for Police Accountability
- At [June 5 East Bay For Everyone candidate forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUNW19V35bQ), Vella noted that she advocated for 25% affordable units for developing in Alameda. This type of advocacy work usually causes new housing developments to be cancelled.

#### [Mia Bonta](http://www.miabonta.com/) (Alameda)
- Name recognition: married to recently-resigned AD18 Assemblymember and newly-installed CA Attorney General Rob Bonta. What will this mean for legislators she doesn’t like? we only know enough to ask, not enough to speculate!
- Alameda Unified School District Board president
- CEO of the controversial Oakland Promise
- [~~Has a campaign page with no bio, no platform, no endorsements - but many ways to donate~~](https://miabonta.com/) [Now has a campaign website!](https://miabonta.com/) possibly updated now that she's graduated from Emerge California? (She last-minute backed out of a June 5 candidate forum because it overlapped with her program graduation)
- Heavily endorsed at state and national and local levels - most notably, Barbara Lee rarely endorses (and even scolded candidates last election for implying an endorsement).
- Endorsed by Oakland City Councilmembers for Districts 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7

#### [Victor Aguilar](https://victorforca.com/) (San Leandro)
- Current (and first openly gay) [San Leandro City Councilmember](https://www.sanleandro.org/depts/council/dist3.asp)
39:24

- Cares a lot about public health policy

#### [James Aguilar](https://www.jamesforcalifornia.com/) (San Leandro)
- Includes high school civic accomplishments in his “About Me”

- [(June 5 East Bay For Everyone candidate forum / 54:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUNW19V35bQ) Based on his experience as a legislative intern, thinks there are unnecessary barriers to scheduling meetings with legislators and their offices
- Rents in San Leandro

## Candidate forums and questionnaires

There have been a number of candidate forums, and more are coming up still!

You may be particularly interested in the [(June 5 East Bay For Everyone candidate forum)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUNW19V35bQ) which asked candidates (39:24) "Do you support the move to de-police traffic enforcement, and what legislative actions would ensure safe streets without armed police?".  (Note: two candidates did not answer this question: Mia Bonta backed out of this forum entirely, and Janani Ramachandran had to leave the forum early.)

(Note: East Bay For Everyone [planned to give no endorsement for this race](https://eastbayforeveryone.org/2021/06/07/ad18-special-election-candidate-forum/))

[Oakland East Bay Democratic Club - AD18 Candidate Forum - May 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPzmEwI0X_I) (result: endorsement for Janani Ramachandran)
