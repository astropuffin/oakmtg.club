## Special Election on June 29

*Oakland!*  Some of us have a very important special election happening on **June 29** (as always, if you ask early you can vote by mail).  Given the short turnaround coinciding with municipal budget shenanigans, we aren’t publishing a full voter guide - but we do have some tidbits for you, the voter who wishes to be informed!


## What should I know about the June 29 election?

We will be voting for a California Assemblymember!  (This is the state-level equivalent to the House of Representatives.)  California legislature gets a lot done on issues around police accountability, housing, green energy, and much more.  They even can change how fast AC Transit buses go over the bay bridge.  This is a pretty frickin important election!

Our assembly district is 18 (commonly referred to as “AD18”), and covers Alameda, San Leandro, and much of Oakland. You can [check if you are in AD18 and should expect to vote in this special election](http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/). The short version: North Oakland is AD15, everyone else is in AD18.

## OK this is important but WHY are we voting in another election on June 29 2021??

Ever since President Biden’s election, California has been playing a delightful game of musical chairs.  Besides replacing our junior Senator with a new junior Senator:

- Our previous Attorney General, Xavier Becerra, joined President Biden’s cabinet as Secretary of Health and Human Services
- Governor Newsom appointed former-AD18 Assemblymember Rob Bonta to be the new Attorney General
- Replacing Assemblymembers isn’t done by appointment, but by special election

Why Rob Bonta?  State legislators are capped at 12 continuous years in office, at which point they are ineligible to re-run without taking a break first.  Rob Bonta was in this termed-out situation, and was at an up-or-out point in his political career.  Whoever wins this election will likely remain in office as the difficult-to-unseat incumbent for the next 12 years before being termed-out themselves.
