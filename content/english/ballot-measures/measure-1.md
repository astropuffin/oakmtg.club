# TL;DR: Allow 16 and 17-year-old Oakland youths vote for Oakland Unified School District’s Board Directors

This one’s for the history books: something that both Councilmember Kaplan and Mayor Schaaf agree on! [Measure QQ](https://acgovt-my.sharepoint.com/personal/rovonedrive_acgovt_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9hY2dvdnQtbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOmY6L2cvcGVyc29uYWwvcm92b25lZHJpdmVfYWNnb3Z0X29ubWljcm9zb2Z0X2NvbS9FbnVSb1VDMThnTkRwTWRvZWJLVmFVc0JsdWplNmg1ZjJrUmlRQlBjdFJfclNRP3J0aW1lPXZkNlgyMUppMkVn&id=%2Fpersonal%2Frovonedrive%5Facgovt%5Fonmicrosoft%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FMeasure%20Materials%20%2D%20November%203%2C%202020%20Election%2F22%20%2D%20Measure%20QQ%20%2D%20City%20of%20Oakland%20%2D%20Youth%20Voting%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Frovonedrive%5Facgovt%5Fonmicrosoft%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FMeasure%20Materials%20%2D%20November%203%2C%202020%20Election) was written by [Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/rebecca-kaplan/), and has the support of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf and all current Councilmembers. If it passes, the 2022 election would be the first in which 16- and 17-year-old Oakland residents could vote for school board director.

### What happens if Measure QQ passes?

A “yes” vote would let students vote for OUSD Board Directors the same way Oakland voters can now. Students are intimately affected by school board decisions. Giving them some say in school board leadership gives a population that has already demonstrated engagement in issues under the board's purview (teacher contracts, school closures, the free supper program) another avenue of influence - and starts the voting habit early!

### Can Measure QQ actually happen?

The details for implementation are a little hazy. As OUSD District 6 Director Shanthi Gonzales notes, “There’s no plan and no resources devoted to educating student voters to make sure they can be [informed voters](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/05/20/oakland-students-may-get-to-vote-for-school-board-members) when this legislation is enacted.” On the other hand, there’s little to make sure current voters are informed either! Berkeley's analogous ballot measure, which passed handily in 2016, has not yet been enacted because the school district itself is responsible for coming up with the money to do so. “Berkeley officials are also debating [other issues](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/05/20/oakland-students-may-get-to-vote-for-school-board-members), including whether to print separate ballots for teens so they don’t vote in other races, and determining whether they can vote by mail.”
