## \#OakMtg (Appreciation) Club

### Who we are:

Your friends and neighbors across Oakland who came together after the murder of George Floyd to try to make changes in policing at the city level. We met after listening to hours upon hours of Oakland government meetings and [live-tweeting under #oakmtg](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23oakmtg). We rooted each other on as we tried to support the movement to hold OPD accountable alongside hundreds of community voices.

Then we became infuriated and fascinated by the lack of transparency and lies we saw so blatantly in front of us. We became hooked on understanding what was happening and why our city is so disorganized. We want to distill our ongoing work to understand our government into something that our friends and neighbors can understand. We may not even vote the same way amongst ourselves, and we think that’s okay, as long as we are all informed.

### What we do:

We've created a couple voter guides including for [November 2020](/2020/guide) and [June 2021](/2021/guide]).

In 2022 we've been pretty busy but are collecting tidbits for [November 2022](/2022/guide).

We also [live-tweet Oakland meetings using the "#oakmtg" hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23oakmtg). Come join us! We started out with and are actively engaged in last mile civic participation: weighing in with local policymakers at the moment when ordinances are debated and passed. We call in to various meetings, including Oakland City Council and Oakland Police Commission meetings, during the public comment sections. This can and does cause Council Members and Commissioners to change what is being voted on.

We want to do more.

This site was made for us to enable more folks to join us. There's a LOT to take in, so we made this website to make it easier to keep track of what's going on. We will build this site out over time, particularly after the election, as we track promises made by elected officials and appointees.

If you'd like to join us, please shoot us [an email](mailto:oakmtg-club@googlegroups.com).
