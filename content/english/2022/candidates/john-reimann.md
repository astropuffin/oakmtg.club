# TL;DR: Down with Howard Terminal! Down with gentrification! Eat the rich!

### Introduction 
John Reimann hates Howard Terminal with an undying burning hatred, and hopes you will too.

### Background
Reiman wants to organize working class people to advocate for themselves, like how Moms4Housing or Parker Community School have done.  He wants a working class party to exist, and spent time in the Occupy Oakland movement.

### Official platform
* $28/hr minimum wage
* Fire and jail killer cops
* Stop and reverse all privatization
* [Publicly owned housing only](https://twitter.com/UCBRachelB/status/1538294135320285184), no developers

### Stance on policing
* Howard Terminal is a terrible idea. (From [a candidate statement](https://oaklandsocialist.com/2021/12/13/why-i-will-be-running-for-mayor-in-oakland-in-2022/): Issues are not neatly separable from each other. Brutal policing is in service of privatizing public goods.)

### Stance on the Howard Terminal A’s Stadium
* [Howard Terminal is gentrification](https://twitter.com/UCBRachelB/status/1538290833857818624)
* [Anyone who supports or does not actively oppose Howard Terminal is supporting gentrification, increased rents and driving more people into the streets](https://twitter.com/hyphy_republic/status/1538290782364258304)
* [Howard Terminal project would be privatization of public land](https://twitter.com/UCBRachelB/status/1538305656716861440)
* [No one interested in Oakland's homeless issues supports Howard Terminal, Oakland should spend the money it would spend on Howard Terminal on homelessness instead](https://twitter.com/hyphy_republic/status/1538286648554688512)
* [“Howard Terminal is a land giveaway to a right wing billionaire, and will be a financial millstone around the neck of the City of Oakland.  Anything other than flat-out opposition to this boondoggle indicates subservience to the real estate developers.”](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02CKgfExjRFxtDaf9R2HPybj17bBHAgHFeZo3VTBW6ay9SZU73ZDyDeYawnjrBmCx5l&id=100077571033709)

### Stance on abortion
* Howard Terminal is a terrible idea.

More seriously, [Reimann’s response](https://oaklandsocialist.com/2022/05/04/abortion-ruling-supreme-court-in-hands-of-religious-fanatics/) to the leaked draft opinion can best be summarized as: Abortion is healthcare. At a time when it is illegal or restricted, wealthy pregnant people will still be able to obtain it safely, but poor pregnant people will risk their health or freedom if they want to end a pregnancy. Also, the Supreme Court is not the non-partisan body it pretends to be. The courts cannot secure this right; only widespread, sustained protest can do that.
