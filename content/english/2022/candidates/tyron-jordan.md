# TL;DR: Your earnest civic-minded neighbor has entered the chat.

### Introduction 
Tyron Jordan is an Army veteran, former Commissioner on the [Oakland Library Advisory Commission](https://www.oaklandca.gov/boards-commissions/library-advisory-commission), and political activist.  Some of the initiatives he’s worked on include Bernie Sanders in 2020, [Oakland Measure D](https://ballotpedia.org/Oakland,_California,_Measure_D,_Parcel_Tax_for_Library_Services_(June_2018)) for library services in 2018, and the [Fight for 15 campaign](https://fightfor15.org/).

### Official platform
Jordan’s top issue is [housing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAr-AZlPAk&t=8m30s):  affordable housing, addressing homelessness, and preventing displacement through mortgage assistance and renter protections. He has spoken about tenant protections in a range of ways, including the need to [cap rent increases](https://twitter.com/hyphy_republic/status/1572760059742162944) and the need to address the [quake vulnerability](https://twitter.com/TyronJordan13/status/1576349668023246848) of low-income housing.  Jordan sees keeping residents housed as “the greatest investment a city could make”.

Jordan is [against coal](https://twitter.com/TyronJordan13/status/1576652320883953665) in Oakland because “the air quality in West Oakland is already poor.”

### Stance on policing
* The problem with policing is insufficient community policing, and police should be knocking doors to introduce themselves
* Police should be fully funded, but police [respond to crime rather than preventing it](https://twitter.com/TyronJordan13/status/1573323980647596034)
* Move mental health response from police to MACRO

### Stance on the Howard Terminal A’s Stadium
[Straight from his campaign page](https://www.tyronjordanforoakland.com/tyrons_platform): “Tyron is against the Howard Terminal Luxury Village real estate deal. He believes that public funds should be used for immediate programs; such as housing the unhoused.”
This stance has led to some [street harassment](https://twitter.com/TyronJordan13/status/1576149362463322112) of the candidate.
