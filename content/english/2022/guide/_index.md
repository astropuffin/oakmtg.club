# 2022 Voter Guide: Oakland's Mayoral Race

Oakland has a ‚Äústrong mayor‚Äù system, which means the Mayor [creates the budget](https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Budget-Basics-FY21-23-17.pdf) and picks _who_ enforces policy.  This is how the Mayor influences what happens in Oakland, and what _doesn‚Äôt_ happen in Oakland.  The most critical mayoral appointment is the [City Administrator](https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/search/?q=City%20Administrator&y=2021), who enforces (or not) city policies, including decisions by City Council.  The Mayor also appoints people to boards (ex: Rent Board) and commissions (ex: Police Commission), where many decisions are made about how Oakland runs.  Oakland‚Äôs Mayor serves a four-year term, and their power is checked by a term limit of 2 terms, or eight years.

There are ten candidates on the ballot, and the incumbent is termed out.  As usual in Oakland, you can use [ranked choice voting](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CExJpiRBxaP/) to pick your top 3 candidates.  If one of your top 3 candidates is elected, your vote will have gone to them!

### Candidates Stance Spectrum
#### Cops vs Community Investment/Divestment Candidate Spectrum

#### Sweet On Homeless Encampment Sweeps
Four candidates have advocated for sweeping homeless encampments:
Loren Taylor, Treva Reid, Igancio De La Fuente, Seneca Scott

### City Council and the Mayoral Race
Because three of the ten candidates for Mayor are currently sitting Councilmembers, we‚Äôve provided a handy graph and table showing you who likes whom.

Here‚Äôs what you need to know:
* Half of the eight Councilmembers are running for a new position.  Three of them are running for mayor, one (Kaplan) is running for County Supervisor (no incumbent).
  * Thao (D4) and Taylor (D6) are not running as incumbents, so if they do not win the mayoral race, will not be holding political office.
  * Reid (D7) and Kaplan (At-large) will continue to hold their Councilmember seats, unless either is elected (at which point a special election will be held).
* Kaplan (At-large) is running for County Supervisor, and has been endorsed by 5 of the 7 other Councilmembers
* Thao (D4) is running for Mayor and has been endorsed by 3 of the 7 other Councilmembers
* Reid (D7) is running for Mayor and has been endorsed as ‚Äú#2 choice‚Äù by 1 of the 7 other Councilmembers
* Taylor (D6) is running for Mayor and has not received any endorsements from any of the other 7 Councilmembers

We don‚Äôt know who made this Oakland politics cliffnotes, and can‚Äôt speak to the accuracy of their notes, but [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZeeINU0a3sn4MdejfhhcYKjlNPPc9ZNe2BW2sFUSJWU/edit#heading=h.dfm3zx7isenz) might be a good reference to dive deeper into the horrible interconnected web of [#oaktmg](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23oakmtg) hatefest.
