### What if I never receive a mailed ballot?

You will need to go to one of the polling places and tell them you need to vote provisionally because your ballot was lost in the mail. This has happened to some of us before!  When voting you should get a stub from the ballot they give you to fill out: you can use that like a receipt to look up when your ballot is counted.
